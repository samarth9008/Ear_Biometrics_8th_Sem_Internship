# Ear Biometrics
In the last few years, ear recognition has become more popular. The human ear is not affected by expressions in the same way that faces are, and it does not require close contact in the same way that fingerprints do. During the last few years, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made significant progress in solving complex visual recognition problems, with notable successes in recognizing natural images.

The proposed approach is exemplified by the problem of ear detection, which is critical in biometric systems that enable image-based, discrete human identification. As technology becomes more pervasive in all aspects of modern life, the world is becoming increasingly digitized. As a result, it's difficult to keep confidential information safe. Traditional keys and passwords are no longer sufficient to protect data from unauthorized access. Biometric authentication has risen to the foreground as a useful tool as a result of this.

Biometric authentication is the process of verifying a person's identity based on some unique and measurable characteristics. Face, fingerprints, gait, palmprint, ear, voice, keystroke dynamics, signature dynamics, and so on are innate and unique to each individual and can be divided into behavioral and physiological characteristics.

Among all the physical characteristics, ear recognition has emerged as a hot topic of research. For ear detection and recognition, many advanced techniques and approaches have emerged. Various databases required for robust ear recognition and detection training and testing are open to the public.
